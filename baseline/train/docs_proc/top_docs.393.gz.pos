We PRP

We PRP

This DT
is VBZ
the DT
very JJ
principle NN
that WDT

The DT

reflect VBP

the DT

the DT

our PRP$

We PRP

What WP

And CC
what WP

more RBR

why WRB

So IN

the DT

looked VBD
for IN
ways NNS

speed VB

And CC
it PRP

a DT
simplistic JJ

Limit NN

Prohibit NN

Adopt NNP

On IN

it PRP
reaffirms VBZ
the DT
rule NN
that IN

that WDT

How WRB

The DT

This DT

the DT
