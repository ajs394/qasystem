The DT

the DT

In IN

Today NN
dimness NN

almost RB
a DT
prerequisite NN

Clarence NN
Thomas NNP

the DT
third JJ
mediocrity NN
in IN
a DT
row NN

It PRP

a DT
cynical JJ

The DT

called VBD
him PRP
`` ``

But CC

it PRP
is VBZ
not RB
very RB
likely JJ
that IN

The DT
opponent NN

affirmative JJ

ironically RB
became VBD
the DT
beneficiary NN

All DT

naturally RB

appoint VB

who WP

give VB

But CC
responsible JJ
presidents NNS
also RB
have VBP
some DT
regard NN

the DT
Supreme NNP

as IN

When WRB
their PRP$

a DT
safe NN
majority NN

they PRP
sometimes RB

care NN
to TO
preserve VB
the DT

appearance NN

A DT
rigidly RB

Supreme NNP

loses VBZ
credibility NN

That DT
is VBZ
what WP
happened VBN
to TO
the DT
`` ``

reasonable JJ
consideration NN
in IN

Thus RB
Herbert NNP

But CC
Mr. NNP

not RB
perhaps RB
fully RB

the DT
role NN

One CD

a DT
free JJ

that IN

In IN

everyone NN

mad VBN
at IN
Congress NNP

and CC
the DT
remedy NN
of IN
choice NN
these DT

is VBZ
term NN

A DT
number NN

have VBP
already RB

Some DT

well RB

a JJ

According VBG

the DT
Gallup NNP
Poll NNP
, ,
70 CD
% NN

American NNP
voters NNS
wish VB

limit VB
congressional JJ

The DT
argument NN
is VBZ
that IN
limitation NN
to TO
a DT
maximum NN
12 CD
years NNS

service NN
in IN
either DT

would MD
end VB
the DT

legislators NNS

attention NN

the DT
national JJ

rather RB

to TO
their PRP$

re-election NN

Well NNP

perhaps RB

But CC
the DT
most RBS
certain JJ
result NN

to TO
tilt VB
the DT
balance NN
of IN
the DT
constitutional JJ
system NN
even RB
more RBR

It PRP

hard RB

it PRP

One CD

that WDT

a DT
horrid JJ

But CC
recall VBP

Throughout IN

the DT
