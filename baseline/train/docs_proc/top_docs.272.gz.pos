The DT

yesterday NN

which WDT

in IN

A DT

which WDT

was VBD
carved VBN
out RP

As IN

including VBG
the DT

began VBD
to TO
emerge VB

All DT
this DT
was VBD
the DT
result NN
of IN
some DT
hairy NN
, ,
last-minute JJ
bargaining NN
. .
On IN
Monday NNP
afternoon NN
, ,
for IN
example NN

Mr NNP
Keating NNP
told VBD
parliament NN
that IN
land NN
which WDT
was VBD
held VBN
under IN
pastoral JJ
leases NNS
could MD
be VB
subject JJ
to TO
native JJ
title NN
claims VBZ
- :
a DT
statement NN
which WDT
reversed VBN
an DT
earlier JJR
government NN
commitment NN
to TO
farmers NNS

Yet CC
by IN
the DT
time NN
the DT
cabinet NN
meeting NN
broke NN
up IN
in IN
the DT
small JJ
hours NNS
of IN
Tuesday NNP
morning NN
, ,
this DT
concession NN
to TO
the DT
Aborigine NNP
contingent NN
had VBD
been VBN
dropped VBN

Instead RB
, ,
Aboriginal NNP
representatives NNS
agreed VBD
to TO
an DT
alternative NN
proposal NN
- :
that IN
they PRP
be VBP
allowed VBN
to TO
convert VB
their PRP$
own JJ
pastoral JJ
leases NNS
into IN
native JJ
title NN
, ,
thus RB
giving VBG
them PRP
permanent JJ
security NN
on IN
such JJ
land NN

For IN
the DT
past JJ
16 CD
months NNS
, ,
it PRP
has VBZ
been VBN
touch-and-go -NONE-
whether IN
the DT
government NN
could MD
broker VB
a DT
solution NN
to TO
a DT
High JJ
Court NNP
decision NN
which WDT
makes VBZ
land NN
rights NNS
legislation NN
imperative JJ
. .
This DT
ruling NN
was VBD
handed VBN
down RP
in IN
June NNP
1992 CD
, ,
when WRB
the DT
court NN
determined VBD
that IN
the DT
Meriam NNP
people NNS
in IN
the DT
Torres NNP
Strait NNP
were VBD
holders NNS
of IN
native JJ
title NN
on IN
about IN
nine CD
square NN
kilometres NNS
of IN
land NN

The DT
judgment NN
became VBD
known VBN
as IN
the DT
'Mabo NNP
' POS
decision NN
, ,
after IN
Eddie NNP
Mabo NNP
, ,
leader NN
of IN
the DT
Meriam NNP
people NNS
who WP
had VBD
begun VBN
the DT
court NN
action NN
a DT
decade NN
earlier RBR
. .
The DT
land NN
involved VBN
in IN
Mabo NNP
may MD
have VB
been VBN
modest JJ
, ,
but CC
the DT
implications NNS
were VBD
huge JJ
. .
Australian JJ
law NN
had VBD
always RB
operated VBN
on IN
the DT
assumption NN
that IN
the DT
land NN
was VBD
unoccupied VBN
before IN
European JJ
settlement NN
- :
the DT
principle NN
of IN
'terra NNP
nullius NN
' POS
. .
The DT
High JJ
Court NNP
, ,
by IN
contrast NN
, ,
ruled VBD
that IN
native JJ
title NN
claims VBZ
could MD
be VB
successful JJ
where WRB
the DT
indigenous JJ
people NNS
had VBD
maintained VBN
a DT
close JJ
connection NN
with IN
the DT
land NN
, ,
although IN
it PRP
also RB
said VBD
that IN
land NN
titles NNS
acquired VBD
under IN
accepted VBN
law NN
since IN
European JJ
settlement NN
should MD
not RB
be VB
disturbed VBN
. .
To TO
complicate VB
matters NNS
further RB
, ,
the DT
Mabo NNP
decision NN
determined VBD
that IN
states NNS
and CC
territories NNS
could MD
extinguish VB
native JJ
title NN
- :
but CC
only RB
in IN

with IN
the DT
country NN

constitution NN
and CC
laws NNS
, ,
notably RB
the DT
1975 CD
Racial NNP
Discrimination NNP
Act NNP
. .
In IN
short JJ
, ,
compensation NN
could MD
be VB
required VBN

Unfortunately RB
, ,
the DT
High NNP
Court NNP
ruling NN
was VBD
made VBN
in IN
the DT
narrow NN
context NN
of IN
one CD
claim NN
, ,
and CC
gave VBD
little JJ
guidance NN
on IN
the DT
practical JJ
application NN
of IN
these DT
principles NNS
. .
From IN
the DT
outset NN
, ,
the DT
federal JJ
government NN
was VBD
forced VBN
to TO
tread VB
a DT
fine NN
line NN
between IN
meeting NN
Aboriginal NNP
demands NNS
, ,
now RB
backed VBN
up RP
by IN
the DT
Mabo NNP
ruling NN

and CC

a DT
degree NN
of IN
reassurance NN
to TO
existing VBG
land NN
users NNS
, ,
such JJ
as IN
the DT
mining NN
companies NNS
and CC
farmers NNS
, ,
so RB
that IN
economic JJ
stability NN

not RB

To TO

the DT

it PRP

delicate NN
relationship NN
with IN
Australia NNP

, ,
traditionally RB

The DT

as IN

this DT

Essentially RB
