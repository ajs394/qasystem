the DT
opposite JJ
direction NN
of IN
the DT
heaviest JJS
traffic JJ
. .
Yet CC
we PRP
must MD
pay VB
the DT
toll NN
each DT
and CC
every DT
day NN
. .
It PRP
seems VBZ
that IN
the DT
mayor NN
is VBZ
most JJS
interested JJ
in IN
ensuring NN
that IN
the DT
toll NN
continue NN
to TO
provide VB
bridge NN
maintenance NN
and CC
for IN
the DT
ever-illusive JJ
alternative NN
transportation NN
system NN
. .
I PRP
submit VBP
that IN
the DT
car-pool JJ
lane NN
is VBZ
an DT
excellent NN
means VBZ
of IN
moving VBG
the DT
vast JJ
number NN
of IN
cars NNS
through IN
the DT

plaza NN
, ,
but CC
is VBZ
a DT
poor JJ
way NN
to TO
reduce VB
the DT
number NN
of IN
cars NNS
on IN
Coronado NNP
's POS
streets NNS
. .
Therefore NNP
, ,
I PRP
would MD
propose VB
that IN
the DT
car-pool JJ
lane NN
be VB
limited VBN
to TO
the DT
high-traffic JJ
periods NNS
( :
for IN
the DT
most JJS
part NN
, ,
early RB
morning VBG
) :
and CC
all DT
vehicles NNS
pay VBP
a DT
reduced VBN
toll NN
at IN
other JJ
times NNS
. .
In IN
this DT
manner NN
, ,
the DT
monies NNS
necessary JJ
for IN
bridge NN
maintenance NN
could MD
be VB
generated VBN
by IN
all DT
travelers NNS
, ,
not RB
just RB
the DT
people NNS
who WP
can MD
not RB
find VB
another DT
person NN
to TO

I PRP
would MD
also RB
hope VB
that IN
some DT
of IN
the DT
revenue NN
generated VBD
would MD
provide VB
some DT
measure NN
of IN
control NN
of IN
the DT
traffic JJ
along IN
the DT
few JJ
streets NNS
that WDT
carry VBP
such JJ
a DT
high JJ
percentage NN
of IN
the DT
commuter NN
traffic NN
. .
During IN
much JJ
of IN
the DT
day NN
, ,
it PRP
is VBZ
difficult JJ
and CC
dangerous JJ
to TO
cross NNS
such JJ
streets NNS
as IN
3rd JJ
and CC
4th JJ
. .
I PRP
would MD
also RB
hope VB
that IN
the DT
mayor NN
would MD
instruct VB
the DT
Police NNP
Department NNP
to TO
enforce VB
the DT
speed NN
limit NN
on IN
all DT
vehicles NNS
. .
This DT
would MD
include VB
buses NNS
and CC

Mayor NNP
Herron NNP
observe NN
the DT
speed NN
that IN
some DT
of IN
these DT
vehicles NNS
use VBP
on IN
these DT
streets NNS
. .
It PRP
is VBZ
frightening VBG
. .
The DT
headline NN
, ,
`` ``
Coronado NNP
Is NNP
Still NNP
Willing NNP
to TO
Pay NNP
the DT
Toll NNP
'' ''
is VBZ
misleading VBG
. .
It PRP
leaves VBZ
the DT
impression NN
that IN
Coronado NNP
wants VBZ
the DT
toll NN
the DT
way NN
it PRP
is VBZ
. .
The DT
toll NN
needs VBZ
to TO
be VB
rethought VBN
and CC
the DT
residents NNS
of IN
Coronado NNP
allowed VBD
to TO
fully RB
express JJ
themselves NNS
on IN

it PRP

I PRP
