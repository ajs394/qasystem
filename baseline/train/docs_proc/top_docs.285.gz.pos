the DT

But CC
what WP

The DT

Yet CC

an DT
issue NN
Chairman NNP

`` ``

The DT

That DT

In IN

the DT
relevant NN

that IN

Some DT

Mr. NNP

both DT

that WDT

The DT

did VBD
not RB

It PRP
did VBD
free JJ
them PRP
from IN

it PRP

This DT

The DT

because IN

Mr. NNP
Melloan NNP
argues VBZ
that IN

Mr. NNP
Melloan NNP
incorrectly RB

attenuated VBN

from IN

The DT
ICC NNP

Mr. NNP

also RB
mischaracterizes VBZ

rundown VBN

that WDT

The DT

that WDT

Whether IN
