She PRP

an DT
engaging JJ
picture NN
of IN
baboons NNS
as IN
sophisticated JJ
creatures NNS
who WP
prefer NN
negotiation NN
and CC
persuasion NN
to TO

The DT
old JJ
picture NN
was VBD

a DT
society NN
in IN
which WDT
males NNS
held VBD
all DT
power NN
and CC
used VBD
force NN
to TO

Strum NNP

that IN

not RB
arrange VB
themselves PRP

She PRP

that IN

the DT
stable NN
core NN

were VBD
ranked VBN
in IN

Females NNS
_ VBP
not RB
males NNS

the DT
linchpins NNS

They PRP
did VBD
not RB

however RB

exert NN
their PRP$
dominance NN
over IN

`` ``

Strum NNP

`` ``

No DT

human-like JJ

that IN

Strum NNP

the DT

no DT

Strum NNP

when WRB

1965 CD

the DT
