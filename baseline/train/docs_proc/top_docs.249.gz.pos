that WDT

almost RB

Tombs NNS

as IN

Christian NNP
era NN
when WRB
pharaonic JJ

sometimes RB

LeBlanc NNP
said VBD
it PRP

unclear JJ
why WRB
he PRP
did VBD

why WRB

In IN

LeBlanc NNP
said VBD
perhaps RB
this DT
indicates VBZ
that IN
religion NN
brought VBD
the DT
ancients NNS
here RB
, ,
because IN
Hathor NNP

The DT

when WRB

`` ``

An DT
